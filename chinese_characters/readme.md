# Ancient Chinese character images


The Chinese character data used in this notebook was provided to participants in the December 2018 Applied Data Science meetup series. From the meetup intro:

>Our data for November and December is a simple entry point to image analysis: automated recognition of historical, handwritten, Chinese characters, some of which may date back to over 3,000 years ago.

An unlabelled holdout dataset was provided as a challenge to those who wanted to build a classifier to predict their character code and/or era.


## Projects:

### CNN based character code classifier.
