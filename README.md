# My projects

This folder contains a selection of Data Science projects that I've developed. Rather than be all-inclusive I've selected a few projects that focus on different Data Science areas or techniques.


Most of these projects were created during sessions for the Portland Data Science Group's Applied Data Science meetup series, which I co-organize. These meetups are run as a series of 4-5 weekly sessions where members work on a selected dataset (e.g., "NOAA weather events", or "Chinese character images"). The data for these meetups us usually a curated subset of a larger publically available dataset, which we provide to participants. Please contact me if you would like to access any of these datasets.

## The projects:

- **[Chinese characters:](./chinese_characters)** Visualization, CNN character image classifier model.

- **[Interactive weather event map:](./NOAA_weather_events)** An interactive map of historical weather events with UI components, coded with bokeh.

- **[Music genre identification](./music_genre_id):** Audio frequency analysis (FFT), visualization, feature engineering, XGBoost music genre classifier model

- **[ODOT crash data:](./ODOT_crash_map)** Data visualization, Google maps heat map overlay of traffic fatality density.
