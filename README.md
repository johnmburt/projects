# My projects

This folder contains a selection of Data Science projects that I've developed. Rather than be all-inclusive I've selected a few projects that focus on different Data Science areas or techniques.


Most of these projects were created during sessions for the Portland Data Science Group's Applied Data Science meetup series, which I co-organize. These meetups are run as a series of 4-5 weekly sessions where members work on a selected dataset (e.g., "NOAA weather events", or "Chinese character images"). The data for these meetups us usually a curated subset of a larger publically available dataset, which we provide to participants. Please contact me if you would like to access any of these datasets.

## The projects:

- **[Detecting Humpback Whale song in hydrophone recordings:](./ACO_whale_detector)** Developed a CNN based Humpback Whale song detector to locate songs in one year of hydrophone recordings. Analyzed whale song structure, and results of a detector run on a 2015 recording. Audio analysis, signal processing, cluster analysis, sound classificaton using CNN classifier model.

- **[Dog breed identification from images](./AWS/sagemaker_dog_breed_id)**  Training and deploying a SageMaker image-classifier microservice to identify a dog's breed from a picture. AWS, Resnet, API, inference microservice.

- **[A Reddit troll rapid detection and warning tool](https://github.com/johnmburt/springboard/tree/master/capstone_1)** Using NLP sentiment analysis, I developed and tested four ML models to detect toxic comments on Reddit. Web scraping, data munging, EDA, feature engineering, Multinomial Naive Bayes, Random Forest, XGBoost, Recurrent Neural Network (RNN).

- **[Building a Board Game Recommendation Engine](https://github.com/johnmburt/springboard/tree/master/capstone_2)**  I designed a board game recommender system that asks a user for a list of games that they already like, and then recommends games based on their game preferences. The system was trained using ratings data from the BoardGameGeek website, and I tested three model variations. After tuning and selecting the best recommender model, I deployed it as a working web app using a bokeh web server. Recommender Systems, PCA, matrix factorization, Alternating Least Squares, bokeh.

- **[Chinese characters:](./chinese_characters)** Visualization, CNN character image classifier model.

- **[Interactive weather event map:](./NOAA_weather_events)** An interactive map of historical weather events with UI components, coded with bokeh.

- **[Music genre identification](./music_genre_id):** Developed a classifier model to identify the genre of a song clip using spectrographic audio features. Audio frequency analysis (FFT), visualization, feature engineering, XGBoost music genre classifier model

- **[ODOT crash data:](./ODOT_crash_map)** Visualized fatal vehicle crash densities using an interactive Google Maps heat map overlay. Data visualization, Google map API.

- **[Residential energy use survey data:](./residential_energy_use)** EDA looking at what demographic and house features predict economic hardship. Feature importance analysis, RandomForest
