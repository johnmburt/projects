# My projects

This folder contains a selection of Data Science projects that I've developed. Rather than be all-inclusive I've selected a few projects that focus on different Data Science areas or techniques.


Most of these projects were created during sessions for the Portland Data Science Group's Applied Data Science meetup series, which I co-organize. These meetup are run as a series of 4-5 weekly sessions where members work on a selected dataset (e.g., "board game ratings", or "Chinese character images"). The data for these meetups us usually a curated subset of a larger publically available dataset, which we provide to participants. Please contact me if you would like to access one of these datasets.

## The projects:

- **[Chinese characters:](chinese_characters)** 

- **[Music genre identification](./music_genre_id):** 

- **[ODOT crash data:](./ODOT_crash_map)**
