    "# IR rangefinder circuit test\n",
    "\n",
    "This code tests functionality of a USB interface IR rangefinder circuit that I designed for testing bird preferences. The device connects to a PC via USB as a 115k Baud serial port. It reads analog range data from two IR sensors and outputs the range values when up or down thresholds are exceeded (that is, it acts as a switch sensor that also outputs range info). Up/down threshold levels, which determine the trigger distance, are set by sending serial text commands to the device. The device also has four LED outputs, two for each IR sensor, which can be turned on or off via serial commands.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### IR sensor output looks like this:\n",
    "- \"aaaa,bbbb\\r\\n\"\n",
    "    - where a and b are integer values indicating IR level for sensors 1 & 2. Higher values = closer object\n",
