They come to naturally mow the abundant cover crop that grows in our vine rows, which is an important part of our approach to sustainable farming. Everyone at the winery loves it when the sheep arrive. There's something about their presence that is calming, cheering, and peaceful.


During the upheaval and uncertainty in the world right now, we wanted to share the pastoral beauty of this with you.


These images of beautiful sheep grazing in our vineyards are set to the music of songbirds, the vineyard breeze, occasionally the geese on our pond, and of course the sheep themselves. Think of it as our version of one of those logs-burning-in-a-fireplace videos that can play in the background of your day at home.


We've repeated one hour of footage to give you a total of six hours of wine country tranquility. This was shot during March 2020 here on our property by Napa Films. The sheep come to us from the folks at Woolly Weeders.

Stay strong and stay well.",,[]

This amazing haven is home to 450 rescued dogs. But this is no ordinary rescue center. What's most incredible is not just the number of dogs who live here, but the WAY they live.

Rather than being warehoused in cages and kennels, the dogs here PLAY all day long. They experience joy, good food and human kindness - often for the very first time.

The cost of care for each dog here is $15 a month, yet we only have sponsors for 88 dogs. Please, please will some of you help us? The Harmony Fund, a USA registered charity, is soley responsible for maintaining the sanctuary and the monthly costs of feeding the dogs. We can't reduce the dogs' food intake for lack of donations and we certainly can't pick and choose which dogs eat. With winter coming, we hope to stockpile some food. This is one charitable investment that will bring you nothing but happiness.

IF YOU CAN HELP US FEED THE DOGS, CLICK HERE: http://harmonyfund.org/donate/help-feed-care-for-400-dogs-in-serbia   Thank you.

Relax My Dog are experts in creating relaxing music to help calm your dog and help dogs to sleep. Our music is composed in-house by our team of producers and is useful for a variety of problems and situations. If your dog has sleeping problems, anxiety problems or is stressed during fireworks and thunderstorms, you should try our music and watch your dog relax before your eyes! 

Relax My Dog's music will help to calm and soothe your dog or puppy in a variety of situations. Console whimpering puppies, minimise separation anxiety, reduce hyperactivity, minimise fear of thunderstorms, stop unwanted barking, comfort sick or injured dogs and calm your dog on car journeys - Relax my Dog does it all! 

Relax My Dog’s music is unique and will help in a variety of situations as a substitute for medication. We have helped thousands of dogs and puppies worldwide to sleep and reduce their anxiety. Music therapy for your dog can keep them calm, happy and healthy, and it is a great way to rehabilitate rescue dogs - or just get your puppy or dog used to their new home. 

Being re-homed is an incredibly stressful time for dogs - as they have to get used to a lot of different sights and sounds, as well as their new family and any other pets in the household. We recommend that you play Relax My Dog during this time, and it will help reduce their heart rate and relax them while they explore their new surroundings. No more whimpering puppies - they will get used to your home in no time at all with the help of Relax My Dog's music!

You may be crate training or obedience training, which can be a stressful time for both dog and parent, and our music will soothe your pup making your life easier. Crate training can be one of the hardest things about getting a new puppy - as being trapped in a new space and away from you is very scary for them. However, when listening to Relax My Dog you will notice your puppy start to relax and get more used to their crate.

It is also very useful to calm your dog during car journeys - which many dogs find a stressful time. They may associate it with vets visits - so we recommend playing Relax My Dog's music before and after visits to the vet to reduce their stress.

The worst time of year for over 60% of dogs is Firework season - the loud bangs are really scary for them and you may notice a huge change in your dog during this time. Thunderstorms are another difficult time for dogs, with the majority of dogs being very scared of storms because of the unfamiliar loud noises. Relax My Dog is the perfect solution to this anxiety-inducing situation - just play our firework and thunderstorm playlist to reduce your dogs anxiety and make them feel safe. 

The most common problem we hear is separation anxiety in dogs, they are pack animals and see their owners as their pack - being separated from you can cause severe anxiety in many dogs. Relax My Dog’s music has improved thousands of cases of separation anxiety and barking canines all over the world - just play them our music when you leave to go to the shops or out of the room, and you will notice a lot less barking and whimpering from your four-legged friend!

So whether you have a Pug, Labrador, Pomeranian, Shi Tzu, Terrier or Great Dane - any breed can become relaxed and calm when listening to Relax My Dog. We are also on a number of social media platforms - so join our community and let's chat! We love to hear about and see pictures of your doggies!

Fetch is a fun game to play with any dog. It involves throwing a ball or other toy, and having your dog chase it and bring it back to you. Many people think this game is something dogs do naturally, but very often they need to learn how to do it, or at least some part of it. 
Here's how to train a dog to fetch: http://dogs.about.com/od/basiccommands/a/How-To-Train-A-Dog-To-Fetch.htm
