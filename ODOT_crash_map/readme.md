# ODOT 2003 - 2015 crash data

This is a dataset from the Oregon Department of Transporation that details all crashes reported in a given year. The data is very rich, with many interesting fields. For this project, I explored two visual analyses: 

## Projects:

### Crash rates vs time-of-day and weekday.
