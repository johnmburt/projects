## ODOT 2003 - 2015 crash data

This is a dataset from the Oregon Department of Transporation that details all crashes reported in a given year. The data is very rich, with many interesting fields. For this project, I explored two visual analyses: 

### Notebooks:
- **[Crash rates vs day and time-of-day.](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/johnmburt/projects/blob/master/ODOT_crash_map/ODOT_crash_feature_analyses_vf.ipynb)** 


![fatalities by hour](./fatalities_by_hour.png)

- **[An interactive map showing a crash fatality density heatmap](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/johnmburt/projects/blob/master/ODOT_crash_heatmap_vf.ipynb)** *

*To see the heatmap, you will need to run the notebook.
