# NOAA StormEvent historical weather event data

My goal for this project was to create an interactive map plot allowing users to visualize the impact of selected weather events over space and time. The plot has a list selector for users to select different weather event types to plot, and a date slider so that they can select the time range to view. 

The visualization was generated using the interactive graphing package bokeh.
